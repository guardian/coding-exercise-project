# Javascript ES6

Skeleton project for Javascript (es6) with Jest for testing.

## Usage
- `./script/setup` to install dependencies
- `./script/test` to run the tests
- `./script/start` to run the index.js file


## Structure
- Code located in [`index.js`](./src/index.js)
- Tests located in [`index.test.js`](./src/index.test.js)

However, you're free to organise your code as you like.
